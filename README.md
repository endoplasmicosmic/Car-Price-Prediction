# Car-Price-Prediction üöóüìà  
A machine learning project to identify the key features that influence car prices, using the Car Price Assignment dataset. This project combines data preprocessing, exploratory visual analysis, and predictive modeling to help understand what drives car value.

---

## üîç Overview

As car buyers become more data-savvy and the market gets more competitive, being able to predict and understand car prices is more relevant than ever. In this project, we used machine learning‚Äîspecifically a Random Forest Regressor‚Äîto analyze the technical and brand-specific factors that contribute to vehicle pricing.

## üìä Key Insights (Before Modeling)

### Average Price Distribution Across Car Brands
![Average Price Distribution Across Car Brands](images/Average_Price_Distribution_Across_Car_Brands.png)  
Jaguar, Buick, and Porsche have the highest average prices, while Chevrolet ranks among the lowest.

### Diesel vs. Gas Price Comparison by Brand
![Comparative Analysis of Diesel vs. Gas Car Prices by Brand](images/Comparative_Analysis_of_Diesel_vs_Gas_Car_Prices_by_Brand.png)  
Diesel cars are typically more expensive for brands like Buick and Volvo.

### Car Body Types & Average Price

Convertibles and hardtops dominate the luxury segment.

### Mileage vs. Price

## üß† Machine Learning Pipeline

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and preprocessed 205 observations with 26 car-related features.
- Used Spark for scalability, then Pandas for detailed analysis.

### 2. Feature Selection
- Focused on engine size, curb weight, horsepower, fuel efficiency, brand, and body type.

### 3. Model Building
- Used `train_test_split` and `StandardScaler`.
- Trained a `RandomForestRegressor` and tuned with `GridSearchCV`.

### 4. Evaluation
- Achieved an R¬≤ score of **0.959**, outperforming the project benchmark of 0.80.

## üî¨ Model-Driven Visuals

### Top 10 Influential Features
![Top 10 Features Influencing Car Price](images/top_10_features_importance.png)  
**Engine Size** and **Curb Weight** are the biggest predictors of price.

### Technical Specs Impact
![Technical Specifications Influence on Price](images/technical_specifications_importance.png)  
Horsepower plays a moderate role; fuel type is less influential.

### Brand Influence
![Car Brands Influence on Price](images/brand_importance.png)  
Luxury brands like **BMW** and **Audi** drive price, even when controlling for specs.

### Fuel Efficiency
![Fuel Efficiency Influence on Price](images/fuel_efficiency_importance.png)  
Highway MPG matters more than city MPG‚Äîbut both are secondary to engine size.

### Body Type Comparison
![Car Body Types Influence on Price](images/carbody_importance.png)  
Convertibles command premium pricing.

### Correlation Matrix
![Correlation Matrix](images/correlation_matrix_heatmap.png)  
Size-related features (engine size, curb weight) strongly correlate with price and each other.

## üìå Conclusions

- Engine size, curb weight, and horsepower are the top drivers of price.
- Luxury brands matter, especially BMW and Audi.
- Fuel efficiency and body type influence price‚Äîbut not as much as power and size.
