Project Proposal: Identifying Factors Influencing Car Price

1. Data and Field of Interest:

    Dataset: We are using the "Car Price Assignment" dataset, which includes 26 features that describe various characteristics of cars, such as engine size, horsepower, fuel type, body type, and more.
    Field of Interest: The project focuses on the automotive industry, specifically examining the factors that influence the pricing of cars.

2. Questions Weâ€™ll Ask of the Data:

    Primary Question: What are the most significant factors that influence car prices?
    
    Supporting Questions:
    - How do technical specifications like engine size, horsepower, and fuel type affect car prices?
    - Are there certain car brands that are priced higher, even when accounting for technical specifications?
    - How does fuel efficiency (city and highway MPG) impact the price of a car?
    - Is there a significant difference in price between different car body types (e.g., sedan, hatchback, convertible)?

3. Data Source:

    Dataset: The dataset is sourced from the Car Price Assignment dataset (CarPrice_Assignment.csv), which is widely available on various data platforms like Kaggle. This dataset contains 205 observations of cars and their associated features, which will be used to develop machine learning models for predicting car prices.
